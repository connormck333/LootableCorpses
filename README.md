### What is LootableCorpses?
**Lootable Corpses** enhances your Minecraft experience by allowing players to loot the items from their fallen comrades.
When a player dies, a corpse is created at their location, preserving their inventory, armor, and even their skin.
This corpse can be interacted with, providing an immersive way to retrieve lost gear.
The plugin supports customization of corpse behaviors, such as fall dynamics and spawn effects, making it a perfect addition for PvP or survival servers.
